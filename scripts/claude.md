# localOpenClawStack Scripts Guidance

This directory contains operational helpers for OpenClaw startup, shutdown, bootstrap, and validation.

- Keep scripts explicit about required tokens, ports, and bootstrap assumptions.
- Use `bash-language-server` for shell changes.
- Verify Docker Compose state live after script changes.
- Do not write secrets or local runtime data into tracked files.
